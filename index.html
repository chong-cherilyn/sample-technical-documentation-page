      <h1 id="heading">Introduction</h1>

      <p>The CSS Flexible Box Layout was introduced as an <strong>additional layout mode to the existing block, inline, table and positioned layouts</strong> that were used to configure box size and positioning in relation to one another using Cascading Stylesheets when designing webpages to respond to different screen sizes.</p>

      <p><strong>Flex layout offers a flex container with the following characteristics:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>the ability to <strong>position items contained therein in various directions</strong>, i.e. leftward, rightward, downward and upward flow directions</li>
        <li>being able to <strong>reverse the order of all items</strong> whilst styling your webpage</li>
        <li>either laying out items across a main linear axis or as multiple lines wrapped along a cross axis</li>
        <li><strong>resize items to correspond with available space</strong> within the container</li>
        <li><strong>align items on the cross axis with the container itself or other items</strong> to create asymmetrical layouts</li>
        <li>both <strong>collapsing or expanding items on the main axis whilst preserving the cross size</strong> of the container</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This makes items stack and collapse according to the desired configuration rather than having to set the layout of each item individually.</p><hr>
            
      <section id="1._Introducing_the_Flex_Layout_Box_Model" class="main-section">
        <header>1. Introducing the Flex Layout Box Model</header>
        <p>All <strong>flex items</strong> laid out in this model are encapsulated in a <strong>flex container</strong> that behaves similarly to a block container however, the below properties do not apply.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><code>float</code></li>
          <li><code>clear</code></li>
          <li><code>vertical-align</code></li>
          <li><code>::first-line</code></li>
          <li><code>::first-letter</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Therefore, all flex items and their corresponding properties can be set within the container and separately from the flow of the rest of the document.</p>

        <p>The horizontal axis is referred to as the <strong>main</strong> axis and is the width across which flex items are laid out from left to right. The vertical axis is also called the <strong>secondary</strong> or cross axis along which flex items are laid out across the length of the container from top to bottom.</p>

        </div>

        <p>To lay items out over a single line, use only the main axis by setting the css attribute <code>display: inline-flex</code>. </p>
